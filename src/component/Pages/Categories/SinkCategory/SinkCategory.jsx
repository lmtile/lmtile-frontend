                            <p className="py-6 text-lg">Double-bowl kitchen sinks are optimal for handwashing dishes. The multifunctionality of a double-bowl configuration is ideal if you do a lot of cooking and washing up as it gives you the support to do both. With two sink basins, it gives you the opportunity to wash dishes in one sink and air dry them in the other.</p>

                            <p className="py-6 text-lg">Single Bowl Kitchen Sinks are the perfect solution for smaller kitchens or limited counterspace. These sinks save space by not only providing more sink space, but also more under-counter storage. The deep single bowl helps you wash large dishes while keeping mess and splatter inside the sink.</p>

                            <p className="py-6 text-lg">Quartz composite sinks are made from up to 70-percent crushed quartz mixed with an acrylic resin. The mixture of quartz and resin creates a nonporous, solid sink that is lighter than cast iron and more durable than stainless steel. A quartz composite sink is extremely heat- and stain-resistant.</p>
